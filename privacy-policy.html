    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>
        Mini Games Arcade ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy.
        This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights
        regarding that information when you use our app or website.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>Leaderboard Data</h3>
    <p>When you choose to submit a high score, we collect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Player name:</strong> the name you enter voluntarily when a high score is achieved.</li>
        <li><strong>Score:</strong> your game score or completion time.</li>
        <li><strong>Game identifier:</strong> which game the score belongs to (Memory Match, Tetris, or Typing Defense).</li>
        <li><strong>Difficulty level</strong> (for Memory Match scores).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This data is stored in our database (hosted by Supabase) solely to power the global leaderboards.
        We do not collect your email address, location, device identifiers, or any other personally
        identifiable information beyond the name you voluntarily enter.
    </p>

    <h3>Advertising Data (Mobile App)</h3>
    <p>
        The native mobile app uses Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may collect:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Advertising ID (IDFA on iOS, GAID on Android)</li>
        <li>IP address and approximate location</li>
        <li>Device type, OS version, and app identifiers</li>
        <li>Ad interaction data (impressions, clicks)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        On iOS, we request permission before allowing AdMob to track you for personalized advertising,
        in compliance with Apple's App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework. You may decline, and
        non-personalized ads will be shown instead.
    </p>
    <p>
        Google's use of data for advertising is governed by the
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy Policy</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Advertising Data (Web)</h3>
    <p>
        The web version may display Google AdSense advertisements. AdSense may use cookies and
        similar technologies to serve relevant ads. You can opt out of personalized advertising
        at <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">google.com/settings/ads</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To display your name and score on the global leaderboard.</li>
        <li>To serve advertisements that help support free access to the app.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not sell your information to third parties.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>
        Leaderboard entries are retained indefinitely to maintain the historical scoreboard.
        If you would like your leaderboard entry removed, please contact us at the email address
        below, specifying your player name and the game, and we will delete it within 30 days.
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Our app is intended for general audiences. We do not knowingly collect personal information
        from children under 13 (or under 16 in the European Union). If you believe a child has
        submitted information through our app, please contact us and we will promptly delete it.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
        Leaderboard data is stored using Supabase, which provides industry-standard security measures
        including encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS). We use row-level security policies to ensure
        that data can only be read publicly and written under controlled conditions.
    </p>

    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of significant changes
        by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. Continued use of the app after
